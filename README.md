XMPP-SN
=======

Repository for the work with xep-0000-IoT-xx for using XMPP in wireless sensor networks or Internet of Things systems

The final result will be published through the XSF foundation, Standardisation work is in progress 

More information will be published through the [XMPP tech wiki](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Tech_pages/IoT_systems)

# working XEP's follow the links planned XEP will be provided during spring 2013

[xep-exi](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-EXI/blob/master/exi.html)
		Defines how to EXI can be used in XMPP to achieve efficient 
		compression of data. Albeit not a sensor network specific XEP, 
		this XEP should be considered in all sensor network 
		implementations where memory and packet size is an issue.

xep-0000-IoT-BatteryPoweredSensors	
                Defines how to handle the peculiars related to battery powered
		devices, and other devices intermittently available on the network.

[xep-0000-IoT-Concentrators](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/sensor-network-concentrators.html)
		Defines how to handle architectures containing concentrators 
		or servers handling multiple sensors.

[xep-0000-IoT-Control](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/sensor-network-Control.html)
		Defines how to control actuators and other devices in
		sensor networks.

xep-0000-IoT-Discovery
		Defines the peculiars of sensor discovery in sensor networks. 
		Apart from discovering sensors by JID, it also defines how to 
		discover sensors based on location, etc.

xep-0000-IoT-Events
		Defines how sensors send events, how event subscription, 
		hysteresis levels, etc., are configured.


[xep-0000-IoT-Interoperability](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/xep-0000-IoT-Interoperability.html)
		Defines guidelines for how to achieve interoperability in 
		sensor networks, publishing interoperability interfaces for 
		different types of devices.

xep-0000-IoT-Multicast
		Defines how sensor data can be multicast in efficient ways.

[sensor-network-provisioning](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/sensor-network-provisioning.html)
		This specification. Defines how provisioning, the management of
		access privileges, etc., can be efficiently and easily 
		implemented.

xep-0000-IoT-PubSub
		Defines how efficient publication of sensor data can be made 
		in sensor networks.

[sensor-data](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joachimlindborg/XMPP-IoT/blob/master/sensor-data.html)
		Provides the underlying architecture, basic operations and 
		data structures for sensor data communication over XMPP networks. 
		It includes a hardware abstraction model, removing any technical 
		detail implemented in underlying technologies. 
		This XEP is used by all other sensor network XEPs.
