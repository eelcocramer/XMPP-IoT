			This XEP provides the underlying architecture, basic operations and data structures for sensor data communication over XMPP networks. It includes a hardware abstraction model, removing any 
			technical detail implemented in underlying technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note has to be taken, that these XEP's are designed for implementation in sensors, many of which have very limited amount of memory (both RAM and ROM) or resources (processing power).
			Therefore, simplicity is of utmost importance. Furthermore, sensor networks can become huge, easily with millions of devices in peer-to-peer networks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sensor networks contains many different architectures and use cases. For this reason, the sensor network standards have been divided into multiple XEPs according to the following table:

	<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
		<p>
			The most common use case for a sensor network application is meter read-out. It's performed using a request and response mechanism, as is shown in the following diagram.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src='http://i.imgur.com/tTGDh4m.png'/>
		</p>
		<p>
			The read-out request is started by the client sending a <strong>req</strong> request to the device. Here, the client selects a sequence number <strong>seqnr</strong>. 
			It should be unique among requests made by the client. The device will use this sequence numbers in all messages sent back to the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			The request also contains a set of <strong>field types</strong> that very roughly determine what the client wants to read. What the client actually will return will be determined by
			a lot of other factors, such as make and model of device, any provisioning rules provided, etc. This parameter just gives a hint on what kind of data is desired. It is implicit in the request
			by the context what kind of data is requested. Examples of field types are: Momentary values, peak values, historical values, computed values, status values, identification values, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			If reading historical values, the client can also specify an optional time range using the <strong>from</strong> and <strong>to</strong> parameter values, giving the device a hint on 
			how much data to return.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the client wants the read-out to be performed at a given point in time, the client can define this using the optional parameter <strong>when</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's an optional parameter <strong>ids</strong> that the client can provide, listing a set of <strong>Node IDs</strong>. If omitted, the request includes all sensors or devices 
			managed by the current JID. But, if the JID is controlled by a system, device or concentrator managing various devices, the <strong>ids</strong> parameter restricts the read-out to 
			specific individuals.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> The device is not required to follow the hints given by the client. These are suggestions the client can use to minimize its effort to perform the read-out.
			The client MUST make sure the response is filtered according to original requirements by the client after the read-out response has been received.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the device accepts the client request, it sends an <strong>accepted</strong> response back to the client. The device also has to determine if the read-out is commenced directly,
			or if it is to be queued for later processing. Note that the request can be queued for several reasons. The device can be busy, and queues it until it is ready to process the request.
			It can also queue the request if the client has requested it to be executed at a given time. If the request is queued, the device informs the client of this using the <strong>queued</strong>
			attribute. Note however, that the device will process the request when it can. There's no guarantee that the device will be able to process the request exactly when the client requests it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>accepted</strong> message can be omitted if the device already has the response and is ready to send it. If the client receives field data or a 
			<strong>done</strong> message before receiving an <strong>accepted</strong> message, the client can assume the device accepted the request and omitted sending an <strong>accepted</strong>
			element.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the request was queued, the device will send a message informing the client when the read-out is begun. This is done using a <strong>started</strong> message, using the same
			<strong>seqnr</strong> used in the original request.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Sending a <strong>started</strong> element should be omitted by the device if the request is not queued on the device. If the <strong>queued</strong> attribute
			is omitted in the response, or has the value <strong>false</strong>, the client must not assume the device will send a <strong>started</strong> element.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the read-out, the device sends partial results back to the client using the same <strong>seqnr</strong> as used in the request, using a <strong>fields</strong> message.
			These messages will contain a sequence of fields read out of the device. The client is required to filter this list according to original specifications, as the device is not required
			to do this filtering for the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			When read-out is complete, the device will send a <strong>done</strong> message to the client with the same <strong>seqnr</strong> as in the original request. Since the sender 
			of messages in the device at the time of sending might not be aware of if there are more messages to send or not, the device can send this message separately as is shown in the
			diagram. If the device however, knows the last message containing fields is the last, it can set a <strong>done</strong> attribute in the message, to skip this last message.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> There is no guarantee that the device will send a corresponding <strong>started</strong> and <strong>fields</strong> element, even though the request was
			accepted. The device might lose power during the process and forget the request. The client should always be aware of that devices may not respond in time, and take appropriate action
			accordingly (for instance, implementing a retry mechanism).
		</p>
		<p>
			If a failure occurs while performing the read-out, a <strong>failure</strong> message is sent, instead of a corresponding <strong>fields</strong> message, as is shown in the following diagram.
			Apart from notifying the client that a failure to perform the read-out, or part thereof, has occurred, it also provides a list of errors that the device encountered while trying. Note that 
			multiple <strong>fields</strong> and <strong>failure</strong> messages can be sent back to the client during the read-out.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src='http://i.imgur.com/5WsyGcW.png'/>
		</p>
		<p>
			The device can also reject a read-out request. Reasons for rejecting a request may be missing privileges defined by provisioning rules, etc. It's not part of this XEP
			to define such rules. A separate XEP (<link url='xep-0000-SN-Provisioning.html'>xep-0000-SN-Provisioning</link>) defines an architecture for how such provisioning can be easily implemented.
		</p>
		<p>
			A rejection response is shown in the following diagram.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src='http://i.imgur.com/Lf2agLP.png'/>
		</p>
		<p>
			If a read-out has been queued, the client can cancel the queued read-out request sending a <strong>cancel</strong> command to the device. If a reading has begin and the client
			sends a <strong>cancel</strong> command to the device, the device can choose if the read-out should be cancelled or completed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Remember that the <strong>seqnr</strong> value used in this command is unique only to the client making the request. The device can receive requests
			from multiple clients, and must make sure it differs between <strong>seqnr</strong> values from different clients. Different clients are assumed to have different values
			in the corresponding <strong>from</strong> attributes.

		<section2 topic='String lengths'>
			<p>
				As noticed, a conscious effort has been made not to shorten element and attribute names. This is to make sure, XML is maintained readable. Packet size is not deemed to be
				affected negatively by this for two reasons:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For sensors with limited memory, or where package size is important, <span class='ref'><link url='http://www.w3.org/TR/exi/'>EXI</link></span> 
				<note>Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format &lt;<link url='http://www.w3.org/TR/exi/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/exi/</link>&gt;.</note> is supposed to be used. 
				EXI compresses strings as normalized index values, making the string appear only once in the packet. Therefore, shortening string length doesn't affect packet 
				size much. Element and attribute names in known namespaces are furthermore only encoded by index in schema, not by name.</li>
				<li>If limited memory or package size is not a consideration, readability and ease of implementation is preferred to short messages.</li>
			</ul>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Enumerations vs. Strings'>
			<p>
				This protocol has avoided the use of enumerations for data types such as units, field names, etc., and instead use strings. The reasons for this are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enumerations would unnecessarily restrict the use of the protocol to field names and units listed in the protocol.</li>
				<li>It would be very difficult to try to create a complete set of field names and units that would suit all applications.</li>
				<li>Leaving these values as strings would let developers the liberty to use units as they desire.</li>
				<li>If EXI is used for compression, the use of strings will only increase payload slightly, with only one copy of each distinct value used.</li>
				<li>If EXI is not used, this does not affect packet size.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				However, some things need to be taken into account:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Since free strings are used, XML validation cannot be used to secure correct names are used.</li>
				<li>xep-0000-SN-Interoperability lists recommendations on how field names and units should be used in order to achieve maximum interoperability in SN.</li>
				<li>Consumers of sensor data need to include unit conversion algorithms.</li>
			</ul>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Asynchronous feedback'>
			<p>
				Since some applications require real-time feedback (or as real-time as possible), and read-out might in certain cases take a long time, the device has the option
				to send multiple <strong>fields</strong> messages during read-out. The client is responsible for collecting all such messages until either a <strong>done</strong> message
				is sent, or a corresponding <strong>done</strong> attribute is available in one of the messages received. Only the device knows how many (if any) messages are sent in
				response to a read-out request.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Field Value Types'>
			<p>
				There are different types of values that can be reported from a device. The following table lists the various types:
			</p>
			<table caption='Field Value Types'>
				<tr>
					<th>Element</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>numeric</td>
					<td>
						Represents a numerical value. Numerical values contain, apart from a numerical number, also an implicit precision (number of decimals) and an
						optional unit. All parties in the communication chain should retain the number of decimals used, since this contains information that is important
						in the interpretation of a value. For example, 10 °C is different from 10.0 °C, and very different from 10.00 °C. If a sensor delivers the value
						10 °C you can assume it probably lies between 9.5 °C and 10.5 °C. But if a sensor delivers 10.00 °C, it is probably very exact (if calibrated correctly).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>string</td>
					<td>Represents a string value. It contains an arbitrary string value.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>boolean</td>
					<td>Represents a boolean value that can be either true or false.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>dateTime</td>
					<td>Represents a date and optional time value. The value must be encoded using the xs:dateTime data type. This includes date, an optional time and optional time zone information.
					If time zone is not available, it is supposed to be undefined.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>timeSpan</td>
					<td>Represents a time span value. This can be either a time of day value, if nonnegative and less than 24 hours, or a duration value.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>enum</td>
					<td>Represents an enumeration value. What differs this value from a string value, is that it apart from the enumeration value (which is a string value),
					also contains a data type, which consumers can use to interpret its value. This specification does not assume knowledge of any particular enumeration
					data types.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Field Types'>
			<p>
				There are different types of fields, apart from types of values a field can have. These types are conceptual types, similar to categories. They are not exclusive,
				and can be combined.
			</p>
			<p>
				If requesting multiple field types in a request, the device must interpret this as a union of the corresponding field types and return at least all field values
				that contain at least one of the requested field types. Example: If requesting momentary values and historical values, devices must return both its momentary values
				and its historical values.
			</p>
			<p>
				But, when a device reports a field having multiple field types, the client should interpret this as the intersection of the corresponding field types, i.e. the corresponding
				field has all corresponding field types. Example: A field marked as both a status value and as a historical value is in fact a historical status value.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following table lists the different field types specified in this document:
			</p>
			<table caption='Field Types'>
				<tr>
					<th>Field Type</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>computed</td>
					<td>A value that is computed instead of measured.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historical*</td>
					<td>A value stored in memory from a previous timestamp. The suffix is used to determine period, as shown below.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalSecond</td>
					<td>A value stored at a second shift (milliseconds = 0).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalMinute</td>
					<td>A value stored at a minute shift (seconds=milliseconds=0). Are also second values.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalHour</td>
					<td>A value stored at a hour shift (minutes=seconds=milliseconds=0). Are also minute and second values.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalDay</td>
					<td>A value stored at a day shift (hours=minutes=seconds=milliseconds=0). Are also hour, minute and second values.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalWeek</td>
					<td>A value stored at a week shift (Monday, hours=minutes=seconds=milliseconds=0). Are also day, hour, minute and second values.</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historicalOther</td>
					<td>If period if historical value is not important in the request or by the device.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>identity</td>
					<td>A value that can be used for identification. (Serial numbers, meter IDs, locations, names, addresses, etc.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>momentary</td>
					<td>A momentary value represents a value measured at the time of the read-out. Examples: Energy, Volume, Power, Flow, Temperature, Pressure, etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>peak</td>
					<td>A maximum or minimum value during a given period. Examples "Temperature, Max", "Temperature, Min", etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>status</td>
					<td>A value displaying status information about something. Examples: Health, Battery life time, Runtime, Expected life time, Signal strength, Signal quality, etc. </td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				There are two field type attributes that can be used in requests to simplify read-out:
			</p>
			<table caption='Special Field Types available in read-out requests'>
				<tr>
					<th>Field Type</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>all</td>
					<td>Reads all types of fields. It is the same as explicitly setting all field type attributes to true.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>historical</td>
					<td>If period of historical values is not important, this attribute can be set to include all types of historical values.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> The reason for including different time periods for historical values is that these periods are common in metering
				applications. However, the client is not restricted to these in any way. The client can always just ask for historical values, and do
				filtering as necessary to read out the interval desired.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, devices are not required to include logic to parse and figure out what historical values are actually desired by the client. If too
				complicated for the device to handle, it is free to report all historical values. However, the device should limit the historical values
				to any interval requested, and should try to limit itself to the field types requested. Information in the request element are seen as hints
				that the device can use to optimize any communication required by the operation.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Field Status Values'>
			<p>
				In metering applications where quality of service is important, a field must always be accompanied with a corresponding status flag. Devices should
				set these accordingly. If no status flag is set on a field, the client can assume <strong>automaticReadout</strong> is true.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that status flags are not exclusive. Many of them can logically be combined. Some also imply an order of importance. This should be kept in mind
				when trying to overwrite existing values with read values: An estimate should not overwrite a read-out, a read-out not a signed value, and a signed value
				not an invoiced value, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Available status flags, in order of importance:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Status Flag</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>missing</td>
					<td>Value is missing</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>automaticEstimate</td>
					<td>An estimate of the value has been done automatically. Considered more reliable than a missing value (duh!).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>manualEstimate</td>
					<td>The value has manually been estimated. Considered more reliable than an automatic estimate.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>manualReadout</td>
					<td>Value has been manually read. Considered more reliable than a manual estimate.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>automaticReadout</td>
					<td>Value has been automatically read. Considered more reliable than a manually read value.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>timeOffset</td>
					<td>The time was offset more than allowed and corrected during the measurement period.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>warning</td>
					<td>A warning was logged during the measurement period.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>An error was logged during the measurement period.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>signed</td>
					<td>The value has been signed by an operator. Considered more reliable than an automatically read value. Note that the signed status flag can be used to overwrite
					existing values of higher importance. Example signed + invoiced can be considered more reliable than only invoiced, etc.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>invoiced</td>
					<td>The value has been invoiced by an operator. Considered more reliable than a signed value.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>endOfSeries</td>
					<td>The value has been marked as an end point in a series. This can be used for instance to mark the change of tenant in an apartment.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>powerFailure</td>
					<td>The device recorded a power failure during the measurement period.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>invoiceConfirmed</td>
					<td>The value has been invoiced by an operator and confirmed by the recipient. Considered more reliable than an invoiced value.</td>
				</tr>

		<section2 topic='Subnodes and supernodes'>
			<p>
				This document does not go into detail on how devices are ordered behind a JID. Some of the examples have assumed a single device lies behind a JID, others
				that multiple devices exist behind a JID. Also, no order or structure of devices has been assumed.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it can be mentioned that it is assumed that if a client requests a read-out of a supernode, it implies the read-out of all its subnodes. Therefore, the
				client cannot expect read-out to be limited to the devices listed explicitly in a request, as nodes implicitly implied, as descendant nodes of the selected nodes,
				can also be included.
			</p>

		<section2 topic='Time Zones'>
			<p>
				All timestamps and dateTime values use the XML data type xs:dateTime to specify values. These values include a date, an optional time and an optional time zone.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> If time zone is not available, it is supposed to be undefined.
			</p>
			<p>
				If devices report time zone, this information should be propagated throughout the system. Otherwise, comparing timestamps from different time zones will be impossible.

		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Localized strings'>
			<p>
				This specification allows for localization of field names in meter data read-out. This is performed by assigning each localizable string a <strong>String ID</strong>
				which should be unique within a given <strong>Language Module</strong>. A <strong>Language Module</strong> can be any string, including URI's or namespace names.
				The XEP <link url='xep-0000-SN-Interoperability.html'>xep-0000-SN-Interoperability</link> details how such localizations can be made in an interoperable way.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> Localization of strings are for human consumption only. Machines should use the unlocalized strings in program logic.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows how a device can report localized field information that can be presented to end users without systems being preprogrammed
				to recognize the device. Language modules can be aggregated by operators after installation, or installed as a pluggable module after the main installation,
				if localization is desired.

			<p>
				The above example defines a language module called <strong>Watchamacallit</strong>. In this language module it defines four strings, with IDs 1-4. A system might store these as follows,
				where the system replaces all <strong>%N%</strong> with a conceptual n:th parameter. (It's up to the system to define these strings, any syntax and how to handle input and output.). In
				this example, we will assume <strong>%0%</strong> means any previous output, and <strong>%1%</strong> any seed value provided. (See below).
			</p>
			<table caption='Example string IDs'>
				<tr>
					<th>ID</th>
					<th>String</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Temperature</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>%0%, Min</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>%0%, Max</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>%0%, Mean</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				So, when the client reads the field name <strong>Temperature, Min</strong>, it knows that the field name is the composition of the string <strong>Temperature</strong>, and
				the string <strong>%0%, Min</strong>, where it will replace <strong>%0%</strong> with the output of the previous step, in this case <strong>Temperature</strong>.
				These strings can later be localized to different languages by operators of the system, and values presented when reading the device, can be done in a language
				different from the one used by the sensor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> The XEP <link url='xep-0000-SN-Interoperability.html'>xep-0000-SN-Interoperability</link> details how such localizations can be made in an interoperable way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>stringIds</strong> attribute merits some further explanation. The value of this attribute must match the following regular expression:
			</p>
			<code>
   ^\d+([|]\w+([.]\w+)*([|][^,]*)?)?(,\d+([|]\w+([.]\w+)*([|][^,]*)?)?)*$
			</code>
			<p>
				This basically means, it's of the format: ID_1[|[Module_1][|Seed_1]][...[ID_n[|[Module_n][|Seed_n]]]]
			</p>
			<p>
				Where brackets [] mean the contents inside is optional, <strong>ID_i</strong> is an integer representing the string ID in a language module. <strong>Module_i</strong>
				is optional and allows for specifying a module for <strong>ID_i</strong>, if different from the module defined in the <strong>module</strong> attribute. <strong>Seed_i</strong>
				allows for seeding the generation of the localized string with a value. This might come in handy when generating strings like <strong>Input 5</strong>, where you don't want to
				create localized strings for every input there is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why such a complicated syntax? The reason is the following: Most localized strings are simple numbers, without the need of specifying modules and seeds. This makes
				it very efficient to store it as an attribute instead of having to create subelements for every localized field. It's an exception to the rule, to need multiple steps
				or seeds in the generation of localized strings. Therefore, attributes is an efficient means to specify localization. However, in the general case, a single string ID
				is not sufficient and multiple steps are required, some seeded.

		<p>
			This document has not touched upon security in sensor networks. There are mainly three concerns that implementers of sensor networks need to consider:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Communication should be restricted to friends as long as possible. Approved friendships provide a mechanism of limiting sensor information to authorized and authenticated users.
				However, there are cases where multicast messages may want to go outside of recognized friendships. More information about such use cases, see the
				XEP <link url='xep-0000-SN-Multicast.html'>xep-0000-SN-Multicast</link>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sensors may have very limited user interfaces. Even though installation of sensor networks is beyond the scope of this document, a simple installation scheme may include a
				single LED on the sensor that lights up for a time after receiving a friendship request. If a user presses a button on the device while the LED is lit, the friendship request
				is acknowledged, and communication is authorized.
			</li>
			<li>
				More advanced access rights, privileges, automatic friendship recognition, etc., may be managed by a third party. How to implement more advanced provisioning and detailed
				access rights to sensor information is detailed in the XEP <link url='xep-0000-SN-Provisioning.html'>xep-0000-SN-Provisioning</link>.
			</li>
